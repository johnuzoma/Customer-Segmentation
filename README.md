# Customer-Segmentation

Project attempts to create optimal segments of store customers with K-Means clustering models, to optimize marketing campaigns and effectively target each segment of customers, tailoring specific services to their needs.

## Data
Data set consists of information about 2000 individuals from a given area (could be representative of a county).

The information contained, comes from the purchasing behavior of these 2000 individuals when entering a physical FMCG store. All data has been collected through the loyalty cards they use at checkout.

Before imported into Jupyter Notebook, the data has been pre-processed, with variables encoded numerically and missing values dealt. Volume of the data set has been restricted and privacy of the customers has been protected via anonymisation.
